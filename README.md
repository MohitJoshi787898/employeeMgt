# employeeManagement

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve || npm run frontend` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## JSON databse server

Run `npm run dbserver || json-server -w src/dbserver/db.json` for a events.json file live server, On successfull booking the the no.of tickets get updated in realtime, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` for this json databse server.

## To run both Development server and Database server at once

Run `npm start` command to run both dev and json databse servers with in a single commad from 
package.json -> scripts -> `"start": "(start npm run frontend && start npm run dbserver) || (npm run frontend & npm run dbserver)"`

## NOTE 
As per the application requirements given, it was requested to get the events related data from a local JSON file through http crud operations, I tried using a live `"json-server"``(https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)`, but stackblitz is not allowing to run both frontend and dbserver in same container application url. So instead of using a live json-server, I am using `"HttpClient-get"`  and  `"localStorage API"` to read and write the data in the application
